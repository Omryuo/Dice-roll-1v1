# Dice-roll-1v1– Who Wins? 

This is a simple web-based game that uses **JavaScript and the DOM** to simulate a dice roll between two players and determine the winner. Each player rolls a virtual dice, and the game compares the results to declare the winner or a draw.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. Two players roll a **six-sided dice** when they click the "Roll Dice" button.  
2. The game generates random numbers (1-6) for each player using `Math.random()`.  
3. The corresponding **dice images** update dynamically in the UI.  
4. The game **compares the values** and displays the result:  
   - 🎯 If **Player 1’s dice roll** is higher, they win.  
   - 🎯 If **Player 2’s dice roll** is higher, they win.  
   - 🤝 If both rolls are the same, it’s a **draw**.  

🚀 **Enjoy rolling the dice!** 🎲
